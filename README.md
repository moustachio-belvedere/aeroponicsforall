# *Aeroponics for All*

This repository contains software to log sensors and images from an aeroponics growing kit, and send them to a simple web-app.

The server is written in Python and the front-end is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

It was written as part of the Aeroponics for All outreach project at the University of Cambridge Engineering Department.

Though the software here was written by Louis Kaplan (moustachio-belvedere), the project was a collaboration between Fergus Riche, Alexandre Kabla and Louis Kaplan.
